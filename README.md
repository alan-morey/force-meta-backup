# force-meta-backup

A tool to help download Salesforce.com Metadata.

Using the Salesforce Metadata API, this tool will dynamically generate Ant `build.xml` files and Salesforce Metadata `package.xml` files for downloading the Metadata from your Organisation.

The metadata is downloaded in 3 phases:
- All bulk retrievable components are downloaded first, the `bulkRetrievable` Ant target is dynamically generated and executed.
- Queries are performed on the Salesforce Org. to determine all folders for Dashboards, Documents, Email Templates and Reports. Then `build.xml` and `package.xml` files are dynamically generated with this information. A bulk retrieve is then invoked for all folders and content.
- The remaining miscellaneous metadata components that can not be retrived by bulk or by wildcard methds are downloaded by building a `package.xml` file that explicitly lists these items.

It uses the [Force.com Migration Tool](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/daas/index.htm) along with Ant to do most of the heavy lifting. Salesforce [SOAP API](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/index.htm) and [Metadata API](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_meta/index.htm) are used in a [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) script to dynamically build up lists of components for downloading.

## Prerequisites
The following tools should be installed before use:
- [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
- [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)

Ensure the `GROOVY_HOME` environment variable is defined and you are able to execute both `ant` and `groovy` on command line:
e.g.
```
$> ant -version
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.8.2 compiled on December 3 2011

$> groovy -version
Groovy Version: 2.1.5 JVM: 1.7.0_51 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Linux
```

## Usage
- Copy `build.sample.properties` to `build.properties`
- Edit `build.properties` and specify your Salesforce credentials
- Open command prompt and enter command `ant backupMetadata`

The results will be downloaded to `build/metadata`


## How to exclude types from backup
To exclude specific metadata types from backup you can specify a comma list of 
metadata types in the `build.properties`.

For example to exclude Reports and Documents form backup add the following line
to `build.properties`

```
sf.excludeTypes=Report,Document
```
